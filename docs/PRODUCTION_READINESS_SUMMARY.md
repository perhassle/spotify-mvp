## Critical Blockers (Must Fix)

### 1. Test Coverage Crisis ðŸ”´
- **Current:** 1.29% coverage
- **Required:** 70% minimum
- **Impact:** Extremely high deployment risk
- **Timeline:** 2-3 weeks needed

### 2. Code Quality Issues ðŸŸ¡
- 31 TypeScript errors preventing clean build
- 150+ ESLint warnings
- Type safety compromised
- **Timeline:** 3-5 days to fix

### 3. No Production Monitoring ðŸ”´
- Web Vitals not collecting data
- Error tracking not connected
- No alerting system
- **Timeline:** 2-3 days to implement

## What's Working Well âœ…

1. **Security:** Excellent implementation with comprehensive headers, CSRF protection, and rate limiting
2. **Accessibility:** Strong WCAG 2.2 compliance with good utilities
3. **Build Process:** Successful builds with good optimization
4. **Architecture:** Clean, well-structured codebase

## Minimum Requirements for Production

1. **Fix all TypeScript errors** (0 tolerance)
2. **Achieve 50% test coverage** (bare minimum)
3. **Connect error tracking** (Sentry or equivalent)
4. **Run security audit** (npm audit, penetration test)
5. **Complete load testing** (handle expected traffic)

## Recommended Action Plan

### Week 1: Critical Fixes
- Fix all TypeScript errors
- Address critical ESLint issues
- Set up basic unit tests for auth/payment flows

### Week 2-3: Test Coverage Sprint
- Write tests for all API endpoints
- Add component unit tests
- Implement integration tests
- Target: 50% coverage minimum

### Week 4: Production Prep
- Security audit and fixes
- Load testing
- Performance optimization
- Monitoring setup

### Week 5: Deployment Ready
- Final security review
- Deployment procedures
- Rollback planning
- Go-live preparation

## Risk Assessment

**Current Risk Level: HIGH** ðŸ”´

- **Without tests:** Any change could break production
- **Without monitoring:** Issues won't be detected
- **With TS errors:** Runtime failures likely

## Recommendation

**DO NOT DEPLOY TO PRODUCTION** until:
1. Test coverage reaches minimum 50%
2. All TypeScript errors are resolved
3. Production monitoring is connected
4. Security audit is passed

**Estimated Time to Production Ready: 4-5 weeks**
